Griffin eloquently conveys the idea that God places individuals in our path, each with a unique role, to help us grow, learn, and make a positive impact.\n\nAs you immerse yourself in these pages, you’ll discover the transformative power of reaching out to someone in need, of being the light that guides others through their darkest moments.
